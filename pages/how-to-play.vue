        <h3>Welcome to the game here is a quick stating guide</h3>
        <p class="py-2 first-letter:text-4xl">
            To start the game first you need to start a chat, you can either create a new
            chat or join an existing one (if you've played before)
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            After creating the game go ahead and add players or play by your-self if you
            want, the first part is just to add words, go ahead and type the first thing
            that comes to mind.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            When you feel like you have enough words in the game you can switch to
            guessing mode, now you have to think backwords! and try to guess each word
            going back to the original word
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            The aim of the game is to guess the word in as few attempts as possible
        </p>
        <h5 class="py-2 text-2xl">Happy playing!</h5>
